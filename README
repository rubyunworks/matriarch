== DESCRIPTION:

Matriarch is an experimental implementation of *trait matricies*.
Trait matricies can be thought of as a linked grid of method nodes,
like linked lists but each node is connected in one direction to
it's super and sub methods, and in the other with its fellow
categorical set, something akin to a module.

Please keep in mind this library is far from any sort of full
working order, and is provided "AS IS" primarily as means to
further exploration into the concept of *trait matricies*.


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Very flexible inheritance system
* Experimental implementation


== RELEASE NOTES:

Please see HISTORY file.


== SYNOPSIS:

Matriarch uses +to+ instead of +def+ to define method *nodes*.
This was done simply becuase it was much easier to code then
using Ruby's #method_added hook.

  class C < Matriarch::TraitsObject
    to :x do
      "C#x"
    end
    to :s do
      self
    end
  end

  c = C.new

  c.x.assert == "C#x"

See the RDocs for more information.


== INSTALLATION:

Per the usual RubyGems:

  $ sudo gem install matriarch
